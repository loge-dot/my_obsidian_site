Accordingly, businesses increasingly need to know how to capture and analyse such data to gain managerial and strategic insights that will improve their competitive position. This course is fundamentally about where various sources of data come from; how to pull it and transform it; how to analyse it through basic data mining, data visualization, and basic analytics techniques; and how to gain original insights from such analyses. Hands-on technical skill development will strongly focus on using Python programming for data scrapping, data mining, and data analytics. Students will also learn the basics of Tableau for data visualization and reporting. This course will set the foundation for other courses in which the student will be expected to find, clean, and use original data, and where more advanced forms of analytics will be introduced.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>MSBA7002</strong> <strong>Business Statistics (6 credits)</strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The discipline of statistics is concerned with situations involving uncertainty and variability. Variability greatly affects the interpretation of data. Thus statistics forms an important descriptive and analytical tool. This elementary course presents many standard situations of data analysis and interpretation with emphases on business examples. The statistical analyses of these situations are presented, through use of various statistical software.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">_</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>MSBA7003</strong> <strong>Quantitative Analysis Methods (6 credits)</strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This course introduces the basic concepts in quantitative business analysis to help you gain a clear understanding of the key elements in the decision making process. We discuss methods that are used extensively in business organizations. These methods provide you with the tools and the skills to approach, analyse, and solve problems of varying scales. Furthermore, this course aims at improving a decision-maker’s overallproblemsolving ability by stressing approachesto 1)understand and question assumptions, 2) consider a richer set of solution alternatives, and 3) consider diverse measures of performance.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>MSBA7004</strong> <strong>Operations Analytics (6 credits)</strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Operations are concerned with the management of the processes that convert inputs into outputs. Effective operations management involves managing people, equipment, and other resources. In the typical business organization, the majority of the costs and controllable assets are managed by the operations function. Thus, this discipline–with the techniques, procedures and knowledge it encompasses –is a vital segment of business activity.
